# Savadoro

Savadoro is a take on the Pomodoro Timer that gives you insightful data about your work flow.

Use the default setting, or enter your own times (in minutes) to create a timer that feels comfortable for you. The timer will help you stay on task while you work and notify you when it's time for a break.

###### Examples
  A Pomodoro timer typically has 4 sessions with 25 minute work periods, separated by short 3-5 minute breaks and finally a longer 15 minute break at the end.

  ```
    Work: 25 min / Break: 5 min
    Work: 25 min / Break: 5 min
    Work: 25 min / Break: 5 min
    Work: 25 min / Break: 15 min
  ```

  However, you can edit this any way you'd like. Here's one more example: 2 sessions with a 50 minute work period, a 10 minute short break, and 20 minute long break.<br>

  ```
    Work: 50 min / Break: 10 min
    Work: 50 min / Break: 20 min
  ```
